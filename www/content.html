<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3>Why would I use <code>rtfSweave</code>?</h3>
<p>Most people would rather use Rmarkdown but if you (a) have Microsoft
Word, (b) you need to generate a Word document, (c) would like a lot
of control over the document formatting, and (d) do not mind fiddling
a little with RTF, then maybe this is a reason to use <code>rtfSweave</code>.</p>

<p>The trade-offs include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>RTF markup is not clean and elegant like Markdown</p></li>
<li><p>There is only one output format available: RTF. You don't get
multiple formats "for free" as with Rmarkdown</p></li>
</ul>

<!-- ### What do you mean "a lot of control over the document formatting"? -->

<!-- Sometimes it is nice to specify where a pagebreak goes (use `\page`), -->

<h3>Should I save RTF file to a native Word format like <code>*.docx</code>?</h3>
<p>If you have Microsoft Word, yes. It is important to save as <code>*.docx</code>
(or <code>*.doc</code>) <em>before</em> making any edits to the RTF file. The reason is
that if you edit the RTF and save the file (as RTF) the file size
balloons (often to 100 megabytes or more) because Word is inserting an
enormous number of its own RTF commands. The easy way to avoid this is
to save the RTF file as <code>*.docx</code> and <em>then</em> edit it.</p>
