	* rtfSweaveDriver.R: I added my name as part of the
	top comment lines of the file. I will next copy this
	to pkg/rtfSweave/R.

	* rtfSweaveDriver.R (RweaveRtfWritedoc): Added 'domain = NA' in stop(...
	so that it reflected changes made in r68088 of SweaveDriver.R.

	* test1.Rrtf: This is an example file similar
	to the mini example in the Sweave manual.

	* rtfSweaveDriver.R (echoComments): This a "first draft"
	of the RTF port of R's SweaveDrivers.R. I think it is
	working OK. It does not need to be part of a package.
	Just source the file and then
	R> Sweave(myfile.Rrtf, driver = RweaveRtf()).

	* rtfSweave-source.Rnw: This is a noweb file that was my original
	litterate programming effort. The rtfSweave package that is
	available on r-forge is from tangling this file.  Subsequent
	versions were called *-v2.Rnw and *-v3.Rnw but they are now
	revisions of this file.
