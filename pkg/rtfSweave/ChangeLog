	* Fixed but in \SweaveInput which required
	\SweaveInput{<filename_sans_ext>} rather than
	{\SweaveInput <filename_sans_ext>}

	* DESCRIPTION Several updates to align with current version of R
	- I now use Authors@R
	- I now include 'grDevices' in the 'Imports:' line. This is because
	  my code includes lines like 'grDevices::dev.off()'.

	* NAMESPACE I now have 'import(utils, grDevices)' rather
	than 'import(utils)'.

	* ?????: I am confused about whether my R code needs '::' because I am
	importing these packages in my 'NAMESPACE' file. I may also want to
	change my NAMESPACE file to use 'importFrom(grDevices, png, jpeg)'.
	The latter is used when only a few things need to be imported.
