	* The `check_brackets' R function helps with checking curly
	brackets in an RTF file. It uses a C function which means the
	package requires compilation.

	* Curly brackets are now escaped in code output
	* Added a test of this

	* R/rtfSweaveDriver.R (RweaveRtfSetup): Added option named
	'rtf.Schunk' which is a string to format the paragraph of an
	Schunk. The options 'rtf.Sinput' and 'rtf.Soutput' are now strings
	of text (not paragraph) formatting commands for the R code and the
	R output.

	* R/rtfSweaveDriver.R (RweaveRtfSetup): Added options named
	'rtf.Sinput' and 'rtf.Soutput' which are strings of paragraph

	* Fixed but in \SweaveInput which required
	\SweaveInput{<filename_sans_ext>} rather than
	{\SweaveInput <filename_sans_ext>}

2015-04-07  Stephen Weigand  <Weigand.Stephen@mayo.edu>

	* 'vignette' changed to 'vignettes' with
	   shell> svn move vignette vignettes
	   but
	* vignette/rtfSweave-intro.pdf was added.

	* DESCRIPTION Several updates to align with current version of R
	- I now use Authors@R
	- I now include 'grDevices' in the 'Imports:' line. This is because
	  my code includes lines like 'grDevices::dev.off()'.

	* NAMESPACE I now have 'import(utils, grDevices)' rather
	than 'import(utils)'.

	* ?????: I am confused about whether my R code needs '::' because I am
	importing these packages in my 'NAMESPACE' file. I may also want to
	change my NAMESPACE file to use 'importFrom(grDevices, png, jpeg)'.
	The latter is used when only a few things need to be imported.
