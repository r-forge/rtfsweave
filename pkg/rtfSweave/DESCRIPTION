Description: This package provides an Sweave driver that allows
 the user to create documents with R code chunks and rich
 text format (RTF) doc chunks. After Sweave()ing the file
 the result can be opened in word processors like Microsoft Word. 
 This approach may be useful for people who 
 collaborate primarily with
 Word users but would otherwise prefer to use Sweave with LaTeX.
