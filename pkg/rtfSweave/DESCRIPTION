Description: An Sweave driver that allows
 the user to use Sweave to create documents having R code chunks and rich
 text format (RTF) documentation chunks. 
 After Sweave()ing the file
 the output is an RTF document that can be opened in word processors like Microsoft Word. 
 This approach may be useful for people who 
 collaborate primarily with
 Word users but would otherwise prefer to use Sweave with LaTeX.
