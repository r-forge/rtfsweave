Description: An Sweave driver that allows the user to use Sweave to create
 documents having R code chunks and Rich Text Format (RTF) documentation chunks. 
 After Sweave()ing the file, the output is an RTF document that can be opened in
 Microsoft Word or another word processor and saved as a native Word format.
 This approach may be useful for those who need to generate Word documents
 and want a lot of control over the document format and also do not mind writing
 RTF markup.
