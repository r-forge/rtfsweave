Some notes I am keeping concerning packaging rtfSweave

* TODO
- Update 'NAMESPACE' to export things like 'RweaveRtfOptions'
  (since functions like 'RweaveLatexOptions' are exported).
 

* NAMESPACE
  I do not know whether I should use 'import(utils, grDevices)' or
  'importFrom(utils, Sweave, SweaveSyntaxLatex, etc.)'.

  From section 1.5.1 of the Writing R Extensions manual:

    If a package only needs a few objects from another package it can
    use a fully qualified variable reference in the code instead of a
    formal import. A fully qualified reference to the function f in
    package foo is of the form foo::f. This is slightly less efficient
    than a formal import and also loses the advantage of recording all
    dependencies in the NAMESPACE file (but they still need to be
    recorded in the DESCRIPTION file). Evaluating foo::f will cause
    package foo to be loaded, but not attached, if it was not loaded
    already-this can be an advantage in delaying the loading of a
    rarely used package.

* What does the 'utils' package export?
  R> e <- getNamespaceExports("utils"); e[grepl("weave", e)]

   [1] "makeRweaveLatexCodeRunner" "RweaveChunkPrefix"        
   [3] "RweaveEvalWithOpt"         "RweaveLatex"              
   [5] "RweaveLatexFinish"         "RweaveLatexOptions"       
   [7] "RweaveLatexSetup"          "RweaveLatexWritedoc"      
   [9] "RweaveTryStop"             "Sweave"                   
  [11] "SweaveHooks"               "SweaveSyntaxLatex"        
  [13] "SweaveSyntaxNoweb"         "SweaveSyntConv"           

  It does not appear to export 'SweaveParseOptions' which I need.
