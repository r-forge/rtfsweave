Description: An Sweave driver that allows the user to use Sweave to create
 documents having R code chunks and Rich Text Format (RTF) documentation chunks. 
 After Sweave()ing the file, the output is an RTF document that can be opened in
 Microsoft Word and saved as a DOC or DOCX file. This approach may be useful
 for those (a) targeting Microsoft Word output, (b) needing a high degree of control
 over the formatting of the document, and (c) willing to embrace the LaTeX-like
 markup of RTF.
