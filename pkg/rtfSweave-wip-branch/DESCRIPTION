Description: An Sweave driver that allows the user to use Sweave to create
 documents having R code chunks and Rich Text Format (RTF) documentation chunks. 
 After Sweave()ing the file, the output is an RTF document that can be opened in
 word processors like Microsoft Word. This approach may be useful for people who 
 collaborate primarily with Word users but would otherwise prefer to use Sweave
 with LaTeX.
