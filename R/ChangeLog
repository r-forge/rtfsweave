	* SweaveDrivers.R in the current directory was renamed via:
	shell> svn mv SweaveDrivers.R SweaveDrivers.r66798.R
	to have the name reflect the revision number.

	* SweaveDrivers.r66798.R was obtained with
	shell> svn export -r66798 http://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/utils/R/SweaveDrivers.R

	* SweaveDrivers.r68088.R was obtained with
	shell> svn export -r68088 http://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/utils/R/SweaveDrivers.R

	* Note that 
2014-12-07    <weigand@R5018923>

	* I included Sweave.R from the sources using
	svn export http://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk/src/library/utils/R/SweaveDrivers.R
	and Sweave.R the same way.
